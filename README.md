# mnist-digits-numpy
The classic exercise of creating a digit classifier using just numpy and math

My first attempt at this problem used only the knowledge I gained from watching a YouTube video called "The Complete Mathematics of Neural Networks and Deep Learning" (here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixl3nykKG9M). This video walked through the basics of the matrix calculus needed for backpropagation and the equations for a 1-layer neural network with one node per layer using relu activation. It also walked through the basics of how someone might use this math to implement gradient descent. The model had an accuracy of ~80%. 

My second attempt at this problem followed the algorithm outlined in this paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.09977. This paper walked through the derivations of the matrix expressions used in backpropagation. However, my attempt at this failed and my classifier was not effective. I am still not entirely sure why, but I'm hoping to figure it out with more study. 

Next, I am planning to find a resource online where someone has already completed this task so that I can learn from them and hopefully create a much more effective model.
